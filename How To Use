Model works with two tables;

Table 1: a table that contains transactions from pos terminals assigned to various customers. Columns include(customer_id which is a unique identifier, terminal_id, transaction_date, amount).

Table 2: a table that contains all data of our customers including those that do not have pos terminal assigned to them. Columns include(customer_id which is my only unique identifier, terminal_id, subsector_name, segment, division, location).

Save the python files in a folder of your choice, go on to create a new folder named "POS Analysis" in the main folder with the python files then save CSV files there,

Run Streamlit_app to launch streamlit application, upload your files and run analysis.
